# STX Workspace Rentals Smart Contract

## Overview

The **STX Workspace Rentals** smart contract is designed for a decentralized workspace rental platform built on the Stacks blockchain. It facilitates secure, transparent, and efficient workspace reservations between users while ensuring fair pricing, commission, and refund mechanisms. 

The contract introduces key features such as workspace listings, rental management, commission-based transactions, and refund policies. It supports granular control for both platform owners and users, ensuring a balanced ecosystem for workspace sharing.

## Features

### For Platform Owners
- **Set Pricing:** Define the hourly price for workspace rentals.
- **Adjust Commission and Refund Rates:** Configure the platform's commission and refund policies.
- **Reservation Limits:** Manage global and user-specific workspace reservation limits.

### For Users
- **List Workspaces:** Add or remove workspaces available for rent.
- **Rent Workspaces:** Reserve workspaces listed by other users.
- **Receive Payments:** Earn STX tokens for renting out listed workspaces.
- **Refund Reservations:** Request refunds for unused reservation hours.

### Security and Transparency
- Error handling ensures robust operation and prevents invalid transactions.
- Ownership verification restricts critical operations to the platform owner.
- On-chain data storage provides transparency in reservations and balances.

## How It Works

### Workflow
1. **Platform Owner Initialization:**
   - Sets the workspace price, commission rate, refund rate, and reservation limits.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Users list their available workspaces with price and duration.
   - Other users rent these workspaces by paying the listed price plus a platform commission.
   - Payments are distributed to workspace owners and the platform.

3. **Refund Mechanism:**
   - Users can request refunds for unused hours based on the refund rate set by the platform owner.

### Key Components
- **Data Variables:** Store platform-level settings such as workspace price, commission rate, and reservation limits.
- **Data Maps:** Maintain user-specific balances and workspace details.
- **Private Functions:** Handle calculations for commission and refunds, and update reservation balances securely.
- **Public Functions:** Allow users and platform owners to interact with the contract.
